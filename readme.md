2048 Game

Rules of the Game
1. The goal of the game is to make a tile with a value of 2048 before the whole board is filled with tiles. The player does this by moving the tiles around the board to combine them with tiles of the same value to form a tile with the sum of the two values.

2. The board starts with two random tiles with values of 2. Players can move the tiles up, down, left, or right. If a player moves up, all the tiles will move up until they hit the edge of the board, another tile with a different value, or a tile which is a combination of two tiles in this move already.

3. Two tiles that meet with the same value combine together into one tile that is the sum of the two values, which continues moving in the same direction as the previous tiles until it hits the edge of the board/another tile.

4. If a tile has a value of 2048, the game is won.

5. However, if the board is filled before then, and no moves can be made, then the game is lost.
